	* ApplicationServer.cs: OnAccept sends BeginAccept exceptions back
	to the client and then re-throws the exception. Fixes bug #609787

	* LingeringNetworkStream.cs: shutdown our side in LingeringClose,
	otherwise it will take 50ms to close the socket.

	* Utility.cs: added

	* LingeringNetworkStream.cs: don't shutdown the socket in 
	LingeringClose - it will be done later.

	* ApplicationServer.cs: fixed a typo in a lock block
	All the checks for whether socket is connected 
	are performed in a safe manner.

	* XSPWorker.cs: close makes sure to unregister socket, so that
	there's no reference to it held by ApplicationServer.

	* ApplicationServer.cs: added a new public method,
	ShutdownSockets, to be called in single app mode to properly close
	all the listening and the accepted sockets.
	Added a pair of methods, {Register,Unregister}Socket to keep track
	of all the sockets to clean up in ShutdownSockets above.
	All sockets have SO_LINGER on.
