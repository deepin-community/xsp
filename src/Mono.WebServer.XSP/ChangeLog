	* XSPWorkerRequest.cs: avoid double handle close when sending
	response from a file in certain cases.

2010-03-31  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* main.cs: wrapped --pidfile option body in try/catch block, as
	the failure to create the PID file is not critical.

	* XSPWorker.cs: all the checks for whether socket is connected 
	are performed in a safe manner.

	* main.cs: added some documentation on RealMain.
	Added code to make sure single app mode is not used when running a
	non-stop server.
	In single app mode, when ThreadAbortException is thrown, make sure
	to shutdown up all the accepted sockets, or we'll end up with
	sockets with filled receive/send queues.
