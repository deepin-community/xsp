This directory contains a small test suite to check for any regressions
in XSP that could cause security vulnerabilities. Contributions are welcome!

Directory structure for the tests

/NOACCESS
/webroot/
	index.aspx

Some tests try to access index.aspx to retrieve its source code. Other 
tests try to access the file NOACCESS that resides outside the root of
the web server.

* Tests execution (using the same computer)

From a terminal window:

	cd xsp/unittests/webroot
	xsp

From another terminal window:

	cd xsp/unittests/Tests.XSP.Security
	make run-test-local


* Tests execution (using different computers)

From the server computer (e.g. named "server.test.my"):

	cd xsp/unittests/webroot
	xsp --port 80

From the client computer

	cd xsp/unittests/Tests.XSP.Security
	XSP_TEST_HOST=server.test.my:80 make run-test
