      (as of 1.0.9) added additional questions that have not been translated.
      - Added a partial French translation from Jean-Luc Coulon (f5ibh)
        <jean-luc.coulon@wanadoo.fr>. There was a secondary French

    + Removed all the lintian warnings.

      properly (thanks to tjfontaine).
    + Working on getting the interaction between this and mod-mono working
      properly with dependencies.
    + Updated all of the paths with the new layout differences from 1.0.5
      and 1.0.9. Upstream significantly changed the layout of both the
      source package and the installation locations.
  * Mirco 'meebey' Bauer

    + xsp should create his own chroot (SHARED_DIR) (closes: #259163)

      using the vhosts as * and not as localhost (a realname)
  * Fabian Fagerholm <fabbe@paniq.net> (closes: #268668)
    + README.Debian: rewrote this, incorporating all the currently relevant info.

      info.

xsp (0.9-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * I noted that the daemon was not starting when the user boots the computer, 
    there reason is that in postinst (and postrm) there's no update-rc.d to 
    add the daemons to the init levels.
  * Also, the 'debian' way tells that I can these daemon can only be added in 
    postinst and removed in postrm (purge), so if the user only do a apt-get 
    remove package the package will be started again and again, so to fix this
    issue is to add a test -x $DAEMON to the init, before anything :-)  
  * Fixed a bug in the update scripts: Sometimes the user doesn't reads the 
    README of the package, so sometimes the user will add their hosts to the 
    main configuration file (like /etc/xsp/mono-xsp-hosts.conf) with no dirs 
    in conf.d, so, to prevent 'two' wrong configurations we should 'clean up' 
    the main configuration file and THEN start with a new one.

    they don't have thesepackages.

xsp (0.9-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug in the reader scripts, we should read the file only if it 
    exists.
  * Also, the same bug in the update scripts, just copy the file (tmp) if it exists..

xsp (0.9-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * The reader scripts were not printing (duh)
  * Force the cp of the tmp host file configuration

 -- Pablo Fischer <pablo@pablo.com.mx>  Fri, 16 Apr 2004 23:19:40 -0600

xsp (0.9-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the old sh scripts, now we use the power of perl (I preffer it)
  * Also edited the asp.net-examples.postinst, we should check if the update script exists
  * Now, the reader and update script are just used by root (usr/sbin)  
  * Removed the asp.net-examples.install, we install the host file with dh_installxsp 
  * In the asp.net-examples.postinst and postrm scripts we check if the 'scripts' of xsp or 
    mono-server are really installed    
  * Removed the two ln -s (rules), we are replacing those lines with .links files

 -- Pablo Fischer <pablo@pablo.com.mx>  Fri, 16 Apr 2004 20:29:00 -0600

xsp (0.9-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * We implement dh_installxsp to install the host files
  * In the postrm and postinst scripts (of asp.net-examples) we just update 
    the 'big' file.

xsp (0.9-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * The configuration host file (of asp.net) is installed with asp.net-examples.install
    so in the postinst and postrm we just update        
  * The installation and removal scripts of asp.net-examples just 
    update the configuration host file and run their update script.     
  * The update scripts (mono-xsp-update, mono-server-update) can restart 
    the daemon or not (by default yes, to prevent: --norestart) and check 
    the md5sum of the orig global host file with the new one

xsp (0.9-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * postinst, preinst, postrm, prerm 
   + These files are now divided in pre and post scripts
  * init files
   + Changed the exit 0 statement. Now we use return values

 -- Pablo Fischer <pablo@pablo.com.mx>  Fri, 9 Apr 2004 15:16:10 -0600

xsp (0.9-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * rules:
    + The .config shell script should be in /usr/share/dotnet/bin, and 
      with chmod +x 
    + We should have a symlink of those files (.conf ones) in /usr/bin  
  * mono-server-reader.conf   
    + Added a new rule: Check if the config file exists, if not, print a message and exit
  * asp.net-examples.prerm
    + Fixed an issue of an if, I should use "$var" not $var, "$var" is for 
      matched and unmatched cases (=, !=).
  * mono-xsp.init: 
    + Added a new rule: Verify if the xsp daemon is already running, if it
      is running, print an error an exit, so we keep a good pid control system
      in /var/run   
    + Removed some stupid debug messages in spanish
    + Fixed the should_restart, it was always returning true
  * mono-server.init:   
    + Removed some stupid debug messages in spanish    
    + Fixed the should_restart, it was always returning true  
    + If libapache is not installed, we should print a message AND exit..
  * asp.net-examples.postinst:      
    + Added a rm -Rf to remove the temp file after each sed
  * mono-server.postinst and mono-xsp.postinst
    + Added a rm -Rf to remove the temp file after each sed     
    + Commented the start process of mono-server, we don't need it,
      we should start mono-server from mod-mono.

xsp (0.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pablo Fischer:
    + For the asp.net-examples package, I'm using a pure debconf file, 
    with a case switch. 
    + For asp.net.net-examples pre|postinst I Added two functions: restart_xsp 
    and restart_monoserver.
    + For the init files I dded two new functions: should_stop, and should_restart,
    the first will verify if mono-server is running, if it isn't there's no 
    need to stop it, so it prints a message and exit, the second just checks if 
    it's running, if it's running it returns a value.
    + Also, added the prerm script for mono-xsp and mono-server.
    + And the files to manage the VirtualHost as exim does with a conf.d file

xsp (0.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * NOT RELEASED YET
  * Pablo Fischer:
    + Replaced every exec to the old VirtualHost app, cause the new name is 
    mono-vhostmanager
    + Added two more rules to the mono-xsp and mono-server init files, we want to
    know if the virtualfile already exists and if there are hosts
    + Fixed the Depends of the package, we moved the mono-vhostmanager depend from
    asp.net-examples to mono-xsp and mono-server.

xsp (0.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pablo Fischer:
   + Removed the old way of VirtualHost administration
   + Implemented nethostmanager to manage the VirtualHosts (asp.net-examples 
      in this case)
   + Also, updated the init scripts for xsp and mono-server daemons, we NEED
      to use the nethostmanager to maintain a cleaner and easy to administrate
      VirtualHost file (until Gonzalo release the app that will do this with web.config)
   + Now, we use the cli-wrapper instead of ugly sh file scripts

 -- Pablo Fischer <pablo@pablo.com.mx>  Wed, 25 Feb 2004 18:15:23 -0600
